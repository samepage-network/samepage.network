The SamePage extension will install a set of commands to the host application's command palette whenever possible. For more about the `Connect to SamePage Network` command, visit our [onboarding docs](../getting_started/install.md'). For more about the `Share Page on SamePage` command, visit our [sharing pages docs](../sharing_pages.md).

## View Shared Pages

The `View Shared Pages` command will open a dialog with all of the pages the user has shared from the current notebook. Each page will be displayed as a link that will navigate the user directly to the page when clicked.
